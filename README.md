# Task-1
Task 1: Data cleaning and preprocessing

## I used chatGPT to create a dirty sales data of atleast 1000 rows in order to sufficiently put in use the data cleaining skills I possess. I have used MS-Excel to clean the data. 
## 1. There are total 9 columns in the dataset, namely OrderID, Date, Customer, Product, Category, Price, quantity, SalesRep and Region. 
## 2. I have used the following functions in order to make the contents of all the columns crystal clear:
   - TRIM
   - PROPER
   - LEFT
   - DATEVALUE (For the date column I also used the text split feature of Excel to extract dates)
## 3. I have used Go to Special feature in order to remove blank spaces and errors and replaced all of them with TBA (to clear the cells filled with erors I first erased the contents in them by using Find and replace.

## Both files have been uploaded (the raw file with the dirty and messy data and the clean file in which I have worked)
## Note: I have added the clean sales file in the Excel workbook format (xlsx) as in a csv format the contents of the file don't look good. I have made a table out of the cleaned data.
